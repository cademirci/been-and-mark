## What Is been-and-mark?

![](screenshots/map.png)

been-and-mark application allows you to mark with a pin somewhere you have been on an open world map; put a photo and a text related with there and the memory. 

In this respect, it can be thought as some kind of simple Foursquare clone but been-and-mark is written for personal usage, like a blog or a diary let's say. I have written a web application
with and interactive map in my internship; then I wanted to put a simpler and joyful version of it into Github, as a self development. Plus this is a totally different idea actually.
