## What Is been-and-mark?

![](screenshots/map.png)

been-and-mark application allows you to mark with a pin somewhere you have been on an open world map; put a photo and a text related with there and the memory. 

In this respect, it can be thought as some kind of very simple Foursquare clone. Only been-and-mark is written for personal usage, like a blog or a diary let's say. I have written a web application with an interactive map in my internship; then I wanted to rewrite and put a simpler and joyful version of it into Github, as a self development. Plus this is a totally different idea actually.

## Programming

I used Django back-end framework of Python, Leaflet Javascript library as the map-manager language, and default Django database manager which is sqlite3.
